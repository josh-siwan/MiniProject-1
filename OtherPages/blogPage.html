    Although 
    massive efforts are underway to ensure that hospitals<br>
    aren’t overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients—such as a<br>
    hospital ship opening in New York and automakers making ventilators—it<br>
    still may not be enough, according to Ashish Jha.<br> 
    “I still don’t think we’re doing [things] as seriously as we need to,”<br>
    he said. If people think that “this is somehow just<br> 
    going to affect the big cities on the coast, I think a lot of places<br>
     are going to get into a lot of trouble. And they may not<br> 
    have the resources that New York has to throw at this problem, and that’s<br> 
    what I worry about,” he said. But one silver lining is<br> 
    the fact that the disease will peak at different times in different places.<br> 
    “Because everybody is getting hit at a different time, we<br> 
    can actually expand the set of resources we have by sharing<br> 
    more effectively,” he said.<br>
